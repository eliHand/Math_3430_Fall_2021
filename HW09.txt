An advantage to using floating point numbers as compared to fixed point numbers is that
the programmer need not deal with overflow issues nearly as often. If a number is fixed
then at every stage of the program the programmer must be aware of how large a number is
while if the number is floating, the range of error greater and so it does not come up as often.

However an advantage of using fixed over floating point is that fixed point numbers are easier
to fix in relation to truncation and rounding errors. While floating point tends to lose a lot of
information on the end of their numbers, fixed point minimizes this and can even be countered to some
degree.
